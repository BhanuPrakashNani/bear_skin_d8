//
// "base" partial
//
// To make it easier to use all variables and mixins in any Sass file in this
// theme, each .scss file has a @import "base" declaration. And this _base.scss
// file is in charge of importing all the other partials needed for the theme.
//
// This base partial is organized in this way:
// - First we set any shared Sass variables.
// - Next we import Compass plug-ins (Sass mixin libraries).
// - Last we import a _custom.scss partial that includes our custom mixins.
//

//
// Partials to be shared with all .scss files.
